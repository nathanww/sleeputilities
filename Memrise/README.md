Memrise is an application for haptic TMR cueing and learning. It is designed to run on Android Wear version 26 and higher. While the basic functions 
are currently working, we do not currently have features to support studies (i.e. log files)

While the memrise.apk file contains the compiled application, it is usually easiest to install it directly from Google Play.
